Jio fibre wants to implement AI/ML in their systems. The activity task is to build a network intrusion detector, a predictive model capable of distinguishing between "bad" connections, called intrusions or attacks, and "good" normal connections. This database contains a standard set of data to be audited, which includes a wide variety of intrusions in network environment. Your target is building a machine efficient learning model using different models, probabilities of bad or good connections using tree-based model. This is a multi-class classification. Fine tune the model and make a model which have at least 97 percent accuracy. “intrusion” is the target variable.
